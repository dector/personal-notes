If you are excited for _(motorcycle)_ adventures as I am (hey you, once you are reading this - this note is especially for you) - check out one of the huge lists of HU Travellers Meeting attendees. For example [HU Travellers Meeting California 2014](http://www.horizonsunlimited.com/node/4888).

The more I read about people like these and the more I meet them - the more I'm convinced that there is nothing supernatural in traveling. Just put your wheel or foot on the road and let it goes!

P.S. Yes, life is more complex than just _do-what-you-want_ thing. But I think that life can be something more than collecting disappointments and broken dreams all the time.
