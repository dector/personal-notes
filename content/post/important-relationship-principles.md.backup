> Hell is other people.

**J. P. Sartre**

Some time ago I've spent a lot of time thinking about principles upon which I'd like to build high-quality relations with another people. For a long time, they were just some implicit stimuli inside my brain. I've always walked around but never proclaimed them loud and clear even to myself.

But one night when I drifted in the ocean of thoughts instead of sleeping as all adequate people do, I catch myself on that feeling that I have something to write down. I did it. In few (?) days I improved that text, translated it and committed to github. There were three important principles about building mature inter-person relationships (not only romantic one) as I see it. About a month ago I've added the fourth principle.

You can find the latest version of ["Interpersonal Relationship Principles" on github](https://github.com/dector/social-interaction/blob/master/Interpersonal-Relationship-Principles.md).

But I'm gonna make a quick mention about each principle here.

**Personal Freedom**. This is really important and valuable for me. I consider any dependency from another person as utterly undesirable.

**Honesty**. No manipulation and no information concealment.

**Cooperation**. I think that with cooperation relationship can be more productive in achieving shared goals. Besides that, struggling against uncooperative behavior is really pooping.

**Discussions**. Very ancient and maybe one of the most efficient instrument for sharing expectations and resolving conflicts of interests. Still, works in the 21st century.

I believe that more principles are involved - better for relationships. Obviously, I can be wrong or incomplete on this list. If you had something to say - [contact me](https://goo.gl/forms/Dvj8VyoQp5XyDJD93) via the anonymous form.
