Unfortunately, I see that many people that are arguing only about their vision on some subject. But they usually don't discuss why they believe in X or Y. And in my experience when I'm moving to meta-discussion (discussion about discussion) to understand the roots of the differences of opinions - sometimes I'm blamed for "pedantic behavior".

Today I watched the very nice video where [Julia Galef](https://juliagalef.com/) ([Center for Applied Rationality](http://www.rationality.org/), [Rationally Speaking Podcast](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/)) explains why meta-updating (and meta-discussions) are useful for resolving disagreements.
