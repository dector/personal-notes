Today's short note is about "finding things out".

For me, it seems that my personal cognition process can be described with two steps.

  1. Finding a better model for some process or phenomenon.
  2. Accepting it.
  
Defining this steps separately can be useful for distinguishing impartial research from personal preferences. I understand that it can't be done entirely. Nevertheless such technic can be helpful sometimes.

Frankly, I'm even not sure if I do care (in most cases) that my discussant will update his own vision. But, obviously, it'll be reflected on the model of him/her in my head.
