See [previous post]({{< relref "post/trust.md" >}}) for better understanding what's going on here.

Yesterday this thought popped out in my head. Usually, people talk about "trust" when they are talking about relationships (mostly about romantic one).

But I didn't mention "trust" in my principles. So I asked myself "Why?", thought a little and switched to another activity. The answer has arrived when I was riding on the empty road today.

Undeserved trust is just like imposed authority. It (or it's power) can be easily abused. And it's very dangerous. I think that cooperation and respect to personal freedom cover all needs trust is considered for.

I can see trust as good relationships by-product but not as the core principle.
