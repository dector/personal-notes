Personal assistants are becoming more widespread in today's world. Human-like conversation is more comfortable for us than simple request-response in CLI interface.

I have a small personal project that is used as storage for books I'd like to read (a simple spreadsheet is enough actually, but who cares). Add here extremely easy [Telegram](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) integration. And soon you'll have the restless desire to play around with your personal companion (I prefer "companion" instead of "personal assistant" to get some mercy when humanity will be enslaved with robots).

But you also need some natural language processing to make conversation smoother. Fortunately, there is nice startup called [api.ai](https://api.ai/) that helps to build natural conversation experience way easier. Just started to play around with it and I loved the result.

P.S. I'll work on this evasive denial in the nearest future. :)
